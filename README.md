# Google Image Mining and PyTorch CNN

This is a fun project that includes automatically downloading "scraping" google images and training a Convolutional Neural Network.  

Install the requirements by running the code below at the command window and the project's directory:

pip install -r requirements.txt

For google image mining, install:

http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.9/


At the example jupyter notebooks, replace <PATH> with the directory you put the "chromedriver.exe":

DRIVER_PATH = r"<PATH>"

i.e.:

DRIVER_PATH = r"C:\your_directory\chromedriver.exe"


There are two jupyter notebooks that shows how to do image mining and running CNN:
